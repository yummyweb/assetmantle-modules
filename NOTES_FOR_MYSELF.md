Each module must have **block**, **common** and **genesis** which is all basically the same. Copy from existing module essentially. Including the tests, because one must test all code. The **module** folder simply contains reusable constants, that are different to each module but they can be copied qand changed from existing modules.
**Transactions** and **queries** are very important!!!
